# Status Log Updates Implementation Summary

## Overview

This implementation addresses the requirement to save status log entries ONLY AFTER a status change, with transition information including "status_from", "status_to", and "id" (execution_id) fields.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Changes (`migrations/versions/20250904_add_status_transition_fields.py`)
- **Added**: `status_from` (String) - the previous status before the change
- **Added**: `status_to` (String) - the new status after the change  
- **Added**: `execution_id` (String) - the ID of the execution with changing status

### 2. StatusLog Model Updates (`gefapi/models/status_log.py`)
- Added new fields to the model definition
- Updated `__init__` method to accept transition parameters
- Updated `serialize()` method to include new fields in API responses
- Maintained backward compatibility with optional parameters

### 3. Helper Function Refactoring (`gefapi/services/execution_service.py`)
- **Breaking Change**: Changed from creating 2 logs (before/after) to 1 log (after only)
- **Return Value**: Now returns single `StatusLog` instead of tuple
- **Transition Tracking**: Captures status_from, status_to, and execution_id
- **Timing**: Creates log AFTER the status change as required

### 4. Test Updates
- Updated existing tests in `test_improved_status_tracking.py` to match new behavior
- Created comprehensive new test suite in `test_status_log_updates.py`
- All tests validate the new single-log approach with transition fields

## Key Benefits

### 1. Meets Requirements Exactly
- ✅ Only saves status log entries AFTER a status change
- ✅ Includes "status_from" field showing previous state
- ✅ Includes "status_to" field showing new state  
- ✅ Includes "id" field (execution_id) recording which execution changed

### 2. Simplified Data Model
- Eliminates duplicate "before" logs that were redundant
- Each log entry represents a single, discrete status transition
- Reduces database writes by 50% (1 log instead of 2 per change)

### 3. Better Audit Trail
- Clear transition history: PENDING → RUNNING → FINISHED
- Easy to track individual execution lifecycles
- Execution ID links each log to specific execution

### 4. Improved API Responses
- New fields provide richer information for clients
- Maintains all existing execution count fields
- Backward compatible field structure

## Migration Path

### Database Migration
1. Apply migration: `20250904_add_status_transition_fields.py`
2. New columns are nullable for backward compatibility
3. Existing data remains intact

### Application Deployment
1. Deploy updated code with new StatusLog model
2. Helper function automatically uses new format
3. API responses include new transition fields

### Client Updates
- Clients can immediately use new `status_from`, `status_to`, `execution_id` fields
- Existing fields (`executions_pending`, etc.) remain unchanged
- No breaking changes for existing API consumers

## Validation

### Manual Testing
- ✅ StatusLog model instantiation with new fields
- ✅ Serialization includes all expected fields
- ✅ Helper function creates single log with transitions
- ✅ Terminal states handled correctly
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained

### Automated Testing
- ✅ All existing tests updated to match new behavior
- ✅ New comprehensive test suite covering transition tracking
- ✅ Code passes linting (ruff) with no errors
- ✅ Syntax validation successful

## Files Modified

1. `migrations/versions/20250904_add_status_transition_fields.py` (new)
2. `gefapi/models/status_log.py` (updated)
3. `gefapi/services/execution_service.py` (updated)
4. `tests/test_improved_status_tracking.py` (updated)
5. `tests/test_status_log_updates.py` (new)

## Usage Example

```python
# Before: Helper function returned tuple
before_log, after_log = update_execution_status_with_logging(execution, "RUNNING")

# After: Helper function returns single StatusLog
status_log = update_execution_status_with_logging(execution, "RUNNING")

# New transition information available
assert status_log.status_from == "PENDING"
assert status_log.status_to == "RUNNING"  
assert status_log.execution_id == str(execution.id)
```

## API Response Example

```json
{
  "id": 123,
  "timestamp": "2025-09-04T21:00:00Z",
  "executions_pending": 1,
  "executions_ready": 0,
  "executions_running": 2,
  "executions_finished": 5,
  "executions_failed": 0,
  "executions_cancelled": 1,
  "status_from": "PENDING",
  "status_to": "RUNNING",
  "execution_id": "abc123-def456-ghi789"
}
```

This implementation fully satisfies the requirements while maintaining backward compatibility and improving the overall system design.
